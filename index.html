				In December of 2024, I graduated with honors from the <mark class = "Pitt">University of Pittsburgh</mark> with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science
				and a minor in History. 
				<br>
				<br>
				During my time at Pitt, I explored several niches of computer science including <u>database management,
					web development, machine learning, and software quality assurance. </u>
				<br>
				<br>
				Although I may not have realized it while rushing to meet college deadlines, 
				each project that I completed enhanced my skills and added valuable tools to my repertoire. 
				<br>
				<br>
				I'm grateful that my education empowered and enabled me to code creative solutions to whatever challenges I may face.

					In August of 2022, I began working as a Content Developer at Ozmo, Inc. in my hometown of Blacksburg, Virginia. <br>
					In this role, I worked in a hybrid, agile environment with a small team to develop and update interactive tutorials for smartphones, tablets, and smart watches.

					During my last semester at <mark class = "Pitt">Pitt</mark>, I had the pleasure of working on a Machine Learning-based research
					project with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Using previously collected data about the tissue health of several hundred thousand coral samples, and the taxonomy of bacteria present in each sample, 
					myself and one other student were tasked with using Machine Learning models to identify potential pathogens causing Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease.

					In my free time, I love doing just about anything outdoors, especially snowboarding and backpacking!
					<br>
					<br>
					I also love to unwind and take care of my brain by spending lots of time reading, often something from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien or Terry Pratchett.
