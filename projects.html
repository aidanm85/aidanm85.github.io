			<h1>A glimpse at some of my projects...</h1>
			<p>Listed below are projects completed outside of my work at Corning or Ozmo, as well as my normal coursework at the <mark class = "Pitt">University of Pittsburgh</mark>. So, although they are not
			present below, I have completed a variety of in-depth projects in Java, R, C, SQL, and more. 
			These projects and labs have rigorously prepared me to utilize these languages, as well as many frameworks and libraries, essential to real world development.</p>

				<h2>Spotify-Linked Side by Side Lyrics Translator</h2>
				<p>
					A long standing goal of mine has been to improve my Spanish, which led to my enamoration with Latin music.
					While the music alone has proven to be a helpful tool for bettering my comprehension and speaking, the meaning 
					behind many of my favorite lyrics still escapes me. So, I'm working on using the Spotify API to build a web app 
					that finds the lyrics of whatever song I may be listening to, and uses AI to translate them to be displayed alongside
					the original lyrics, while synchronized to my Spotify session. <br><br><br>

					Built with Python, HTML, and CSS, using Flask, as well as the Spotify and OpenAI APIs.
